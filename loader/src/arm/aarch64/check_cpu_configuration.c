/**
 * NOTE:
 * - ARMv8 doesn't really have the same thing as CPUID on x86. Instead, it
 *   has ID_ fields that can be read to get feature information that we care
 *   about. Due to this issue, there isn't a clean way to ensure the specific
 *   CPU we are executing on is supported, but instead we can only check
 *   to ensure specific features are supported.
 * - ARMv8 has something called Virtualization Host Extensions (VHE). This
 *   was added in ARMv8.1. ARMv8.0 (i.e. the original) has had virtualization
 *   support from launch. The problem was, this initial virtualization
 *   support didn't include support for hosted (i.e. type 2) hypervisors. So
 *   hypervisors like Xen, HyperV and ESXi all worked great, but KVM needed a
 *   small stub inside of EL2 to forward traps to EL1 since you could not run
 *   the Linux kernel in EL2 which is how KVM works (as it is hosted). VHE
 *   adds support for this but allowing not only EL1 <-> EL0 but also
 *   EL2 <-> EL0, which is what allows Linux to run in EL2.
 * - Bareflank's microkernel is a Type 1, meaning it is not hosted, so it
 *   does not need VHE support. On Intel, each extension runs in Ring 3.
 *   This is because rings 1 and 2 were removed. On ARM, extensions run in
 *   EL1, and any operations that an extension performs that are priviledged
 *   are trapped by the microkernel and handled. This is mainly because on
 *   CPUs that do not have VHE, the microkernel cannot run extensions in EL0.
 *   Even if it could, there would be no need and doing so would only reduce
 *   the overall performance of the extension as more operations would have
 *   to be moved to the microkernel.
 * - Note that one limitation of using EL2 without VHE is that the hypervisor
 *   cannot use the upper half of the canonical address space. For Bareflank,
 *   this is a non-issue as it doesn't use this address space anyways. It
 *   should be noted however that if late-launch is ever supported, care will
 *   need to be taken to ensure kernel addresses from EL1 are not used by
 *   the microkernel, which is something the x86 version of the loader does
 *   when late-launch is used.
 * - For now, the loader assumes we are running on ARMv8 or higher, and we
 *   check to ensure the loader is running in EL2. VHE is not enabled by the
 *   loader so it is never used. Any additional features that are needed by the
 *   microkernel can be checked here, but for now, it is pretty simple as we
 *   assume that we only have ARMv8.0.
