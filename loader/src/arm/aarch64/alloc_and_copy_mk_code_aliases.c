/**
 * <!-- description -->
 *   @brief The function's main purpose is allocate pages for all of the
 *     executable code that is currently linked into the kernel module, and
 *     copy this code into the newly allocated pages so that they can be
 *     mapped into the microkernel's root page tables, creating an alias.
 *     The following diagram is what we are doing here:
 *
 *                          |-------> physical address (OS kernel)
 *                          |
 *     virtual address <----|
 *                          |
 *                          |-------> physical address (microkernel)
 *
 *     As you can see, the same virtual address for both the OS kernel and
 *     the microkernel point to two different physical addresses. The
 *     physical address for the microkernel is the alias, and we create
 *     the alias by copying the page located in the OS kenrel to the page
 *     located in the microkernel. This is done because we cannot actually
 *     get the physical address of the OS kernel, but we can access the
 *     contents of the page using the virtual address. So we copy the page
 *     to a page that we can get the physical address of and point the
 *     microkernel to that page instead. It should be noted that on Linux,
 *     if you do try to get the physical address of the code that we need
 *     to map into the microkernel, you will actually get what looks like
 *     a valid physical address, but be warned that the page it returns
 *     is actually garbage. You can only get the physical address of
 *     memory that is allocated using vmalloc(), which is why we need to
 *     create the aliases, as we need the physical address of the code so
 *     that we can map it into the microkernel's root page tables.
 *
 * <!-- inputs/outputs -->
 *   @param a a pointer to a code_aliases_t that will store the
 *     resulting aliases.
 *   @return 0 on success, LOADER_FAILURE on failure.
