     * - This seems to be an issue on both AMD and Intel, and also seems to
     *   be an issue on multiple systems from different vendors.
     * - One issue is that on Intel, you cannot start a VM with TR set to 0.
     *   Any attempt to do so will cause a VM entry failure.
     * - Another issue is that when you attempt to return (i.e. promote) from
     *   the microkernel, the promote logic doesn't have a TR to flip the
     *   TSS busy bit for. As a result, it has to leave the TR set to the
     *   microkernel's TR which leaks it's resources.
     * - UEFI also seems to copy the GDT from one core to another as it starts
     *   each AP. This means that we need to cache the original GDT so that
     *   we can use it for reference. Otherwise, on other cores, you would
     *   get the GDT you created on the BSP, which already has a TSS and it
     *   cannot be shared (due to the TSS busy bit).
