/**
 * <!-- description -->
 *   @brief The function's main purpose is to save state from a root VP.
 *     The root VP is the thing executing the root VM's operating system
 *     (i.e., the kernel running this driver) for a specific processor.
 *     When the microkernel is started, it will overwrite this state, and
 *     then it will eventually take the state saved by this function and
 *     use it to run the OS inside a VM, in effect, demoting the currently
 *     running OS.
 *
 * <!-- inputs/outputs -->
 *   @param state where to save the newly allocated state to
 *   @return 0 on success, LOADER_FAILURE on failure.
